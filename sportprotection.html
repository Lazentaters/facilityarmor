                <p>Whether your gym floor is made from beautiful maple, a high-tech synthetic, or anything in-between, 
                  they all share one thing in common, they are large capital investments. On average, a gym floor can

                Daily traffic, equipment and chairs, and special events and graduations can all take their toll on 
                  the surface, reducing the playability of the floor while also drastically reducing the floor’s lifespan.

                Keeping them looking and performing their best can require a lot of time and resources. Do you really

                <p>Traditional vinyl floor covering is like a suit of armor- it’s been around since the dark ages but it’s 
                  cumbersome and heavy. You are no longer relegated to heavy vinyl tarp systems that keep the floor clean but 
                  don’t PROTECT it from structural and performance defects. (But, for creatures of habit- turn to page 7…we make
                  those as well).
                <br><br>
                Our Court Armor line of gym floor protection products is like Kevlar. It’s the NEW tech, lightweight and quicker
